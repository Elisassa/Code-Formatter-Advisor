### Suggested Improvements by Code-Formatter-Advisor:

After running the code through Code-Formatter-Advisor, the tool suggests various improvements such as:

- **Consistent Indentation**: Standardizes indentation to 4 spaces for better readability.
- **Removal of Extra Spaces**: Removes unnecessary spaces around function arguments, colons, and assignment operators.
- **Descriptive Function Names**: Renames functions to be more descriptive, like changing `add_numbers` to `sum_numbers`.
- **Addition of Docstrings**: Adds docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of functions, making the code self-documenting.
- **Type Hints**: Adds type hints to function arguments and return values to clarify the expected input and output.

## üõ†Ô∏èHow Code-Formatter-Advisor Was Created

### Project Setup

1. **Initialization**: The project was initialized by setting up a basic Python environment using `venv` to manage dependencies.

2. **Dependencies**: Required libraries were defined and installed via a `requirements.txt` file, including `argparse` for command-line argument parsing, `dotenv` for environment variable management, and others for formatting analysis.

3. **Development**:
   - The main logic is implemented in `main.py`, which handles reading files, interacting with the code formatting API, and processing user inputs.
   - `argparse` is used to handle command-line arguments, allowing users to specify files, output locations, and other options.
   - A custom API client (`Groq`) was integrated to analyze code and provide formatting suggestions.
