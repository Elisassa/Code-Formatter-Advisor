## How Code-Formatter-Advisor Was Created

### Project Setup

1. **Initialization**: The project was initialized by setting up a basic Python environment using `venv` to manage dependencies.

2. **Dependencies**: Required libraries were defined and installed via a `requirements.txt` file, including `argparse` for command-line argument parsing, `dotenv` for environment variable management, and others for formatting analysis.

3. **Development**:
   - The main logic is implemented in `main.py`, which handles reading files, interacting with the code formatting API, and processing user inputs.
   - `argparse` is used to handle command-line arguments, allowing users to specify files, output locations, and other options.
   - A custom API client (`Groq`) was integrated to analyze code and provide formatting suggestions.
