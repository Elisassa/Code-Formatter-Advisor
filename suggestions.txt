Here are some code formatting and improvement suggestions:

```python
# A simple Python script with improved formatting

def greet(name):
    """
    A function to greet a person by name.

    :param name: The person's name.
    :return: None
    """
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # This line is properly formatted


def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    A function to add two numbers.

    :param a: The first number.
    :param b: The second number.
    :return: The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    result = a + b
    return result


greet("World")

# Calling the add_numbers function with some test values
print(add_numbers(5, 10))
```

Here are the changes I made:

1. Added a docstring for each function to describe its purpose, parameters, and return value.
2. Improved indentation and whitespace consistency.
3. Changed the argument style of the `add_numbers` function from `(a, b) :` to `(a, b)`.
4. Changed the capitalization of the first letter of each docstring.
5. Added a blank line between functions to improve readability.
